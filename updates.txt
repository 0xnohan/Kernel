Improvments Idea:
- Maybe use LevelDB like bitcoin/eth to store the blockchain instead of a JSON file
- Create a tests/ directory for critical functions

Potential Bugs:
- Difficulty if someone with a higher hashrate start to mine (maybe not 2016 blocks like bitcoin but 500)
- Maybe add a better validation check in pow.py (double spending, signatures, ect)
- Better UTXO Management (bugs when too much tx and when one of UTXO output is spent (unusable))

Soon to do:
- Build a real working P2P network
- Implement dynamic fees for tx
- Improve mempool managment, delete tx when too long, check for dynamic fees, ect
